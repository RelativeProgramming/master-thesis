# Development of a Method to Model Language Concepts with Graph Structures

The main artifact available in this repository is the Languange Concept Extractor (LCE) for TypeScript (`./language-concept-extractor`).

## Setup

1. Start jQA using `sh run-jqa.sh` (do not close!)
2. Execute LCE using `ts-node "./language-concept-extractor/src/extractor.ts"`

To reset the graph simply stop the jQA server and perform the steps above again.
